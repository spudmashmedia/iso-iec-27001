# Section 11: Organisation of Info Sec

## 22 Roles, responsibilities and segregation of duties

### Security Category - 6.1 Internal Organisation

```
Control - 6.1.1 Info Sec roles and responsibilities
```

**The Responsibilities for all personnel should be defined and clearly communicated**

Explain to individuals in the organisation what is expected of them

All staff should have a basic responsibility for security included in job descriptions and should understand their security responsibility

Info Sec Manager - ok, but not enough


```
Control - 6.1.2 Segregation of duties

There should be measures in place so that duties and areas of responsibility that are in conflict be segregated
```

**Segregation - reduces opportunties for unauthorized or unintentional modification of misuse of assets**

Principles:
- initiation of an event should be seperated from the its authorisation
- no single person should be able to access, modify or use assets without authorisation or detection

Dividing the job between 2 or more staff provides a system of verification of one by the other ( ex 2 keys or passwords)

Segregation of duties - more difficult to implement for small companies (if is not possible record all activities and to review the records independently to identify suspicious or unauthorised activity)

## 23 Contact with authorities and special interest groups

```
Control - 6.1.3 Contact with authorities

The organisation is required to maintain contacts with relevant authorities
```

Procedures to specifify:
- when authorities could be contacted

- how security incidents should be reported to authorities ( if required )

Nominate a person - in charge with contacts with authorities


```
Control - 6.1.4 Contact with special interest groups

Contacts with security forums or any other forms of interest groups or associations specific to information security should be kept
```

Benefits of memberships:
- improve knowledge on best practices 
- gain an understanding of the information security environment

- get advice on security matters


```
Control - 6.1.5 Info Sec in project management

The organisation needs to includ info sec in project management never mind the type of project
```

Info sec should be integrated into the organisation's project management to ensure that security risks are identified and addressesd as part of the projects

2 risk assessments are recommended:
- one to consider the risks related to the activites of the project
- the other to cover the risks related to the results

Responsibilities for info sec should be defined and allocated for each project

## 24 Mobile devices and teleworking

### Security category - 6.2 Mobile Devices and teleworking

```
Control - 6.2.1 Mobile devices policy

The organisation should have a policy and security measures in place to manage risks associated to mobile devices use
```

Mobile devices policy should consider:
- registration of mobile devices
- physical protection of mobile devices
- restrictions on software installation
- mobile device software versionse and for applying patches
- restriction of connection to information services
- access controls
- cryptographic techniques
- malware protection
- remote disabling, erasure or lockout
- backups
- use of web services and apps


**Care should be exercised when using mobile devices in public places**

Mobile devices should be protected physically against theft.

Users should be trained on the security measures of mobile devices

In case of remote connections to the organisations site or databases the authentication should cover not only the device but also the user

When using private devices for business purposes:
- seperate business and private use of the ddevices (ex with a software)
- give access to business information only after the user has signed an agreement acknowledging duties, waiving the ownership of business data and allowing remote wiping of the data by the organisation in case of theft or loss of the device

```
Control - 6.2.2 Teleworking

The organisation should have a policy and security measures implemented to protect information that is accesed, is processed or stored at teleworking sites.
```

Teleworking = 'remote work' or 'flexible workplace' or 'virtual work'

Decide whether to allow private owned equipment for teleworking or provide equipment

Define a policy - conditions and restirictions for telewworking

**Conditions and restrictions on teleworking (ISO/IEC 27002 guidelines):

- physical security of the location
- permissions (hours of work, the information and services)
- communication security
- use of virtual desktop access
- potential for unauthorised access (ex family, friends, visitors)
- use of home networks and restrictions
- possible need to obtain access to privately owned equipment
- software licensing
- malware protection and firewall
- hardware and software maintenance
- backup and business continuity
- revocation of authority and access rights
