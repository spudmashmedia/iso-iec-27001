# Section 17: Operations Security

## 39 Operational procedures and reposibilities

### Section catgegory - 12.1 Operation procedures and responsibilities 

```
Control - 12.1.1 Documented operating procedures

The organisation should document and make available to all users operating procedures

```

**Documented procedures should be prepared for operational activites associated with information processing and communication activities.**

The operational procedures should specify operational instructions like:
- installation and configuration of systems
- processing and handling of information
- backup
- scheduling requirements - earliest job start and latest job completion times
- instructions for handling errors and other exceptional conditions
- support and escalation contacts in the event of unexpected difficulties
- system restart and recovery procedures for use in the even of system failure


```
Control - 12.1.2 Chnage Management

The organisation should control changes that affect information security
```

**Uncontrolled changes to systems, processes or information processing facilities can cause major problems to business**

Guidelines of ISO/IEC 27002 with regards to change management:
- planning and testing of changes prior to implementation
- assessing the potential impacts of changes, including security impacts, before implementation
- a formal approval process for proposed changes
- commuinication of change details to all relevant persons
- how and when to abort change and actions to recover from unsuccessful changes


```
Control 12.1.3 Capacity management

The use of resources should be monitored, tuned and projections made of future capacity requirements to ensure the required system performance
```

**Capacity management refers to information processing facilities but also to office space and human resources**

Sufficient capacity can be achieved by increasing capacity or reducing demand for resources

Critical systems like network gateways or main database servers should be prioritized and there should be a documented capacity plan made for those resources


```
Control 12.1.4 Seperation of development, testing, and operational environments

The organisation should seperate development, testing, and operational environments to reduce the risks of unauthorised access or changes to the operational environment
```

**The operational systems must be kept reliable** and using the same equipment or software for both current operation and development and testing of new systems - can affect the operational environment's integrity and availablity

**Its desirable that development and operational softweare be segregated through strong acess controls**

- seperate domains completely segregated from each other (if not seperate log-on procedures)
- users should use different profiles and operational and testing systems
- compilers, editors and other development tools or system utilities should not be accessible from operational systems when not required



## 40 Protection from malware

### Security category - 12.2 Protection from malware

```
Control - 12.2.1 Controls against malware

The organisation should have detection, prevention and recovery controls to protect against malware and they should be combined with appropriate user awareness
```

**ISO/IEC 27002 recommends protection against malware to be based on detection and repair software awareness, system access control and controlled changed management
```

Guidance:
- define a policy to prohibit the use of unauthorized software and implement controls to detect the use of such software

- blacklist suspect malicious websites and prevent their use

- have a policy aimed to protect against risks associated with obtaining files and software from or via external networks

- use and regular update of malware detection and repair software and scan computers and media on a regular basis

- have some plans to recover from malware attacks

- keep in touch with latest information on malware attacks

- isolating environments where malware infection can lead to catastrophic impacts from the organisation - if there are such environments

**For systems where sensitive information is being processed, the use of more than one vendor's antivirus software may improve detection rate**


## 41 Backup

### Security Category - 12.3 Backup

```
Control - 12.3.1 Information backup

The organisation should have a backup policy to ensure that backups of information and software are taken and tested regularly
```

Guidelines for the backup policy:

- the extent of backup should be in line with the business requirements and the criticality of the information being backed-up

- the backups should be located where they cannot be damaged by a disaster at the main site

- if the information backed up require so - encryption should be used

- backup media should be tested periodically to ensure they can be relied upong

- testing of the capacity to restore backup data should be performed

Real time backup / Automated backup / User initiated backup


## 42 Logging and monitoring

### Security Category - 12.4 Logging and monitoring

```
Control - 12.4.1. Event Logging

Event logs record user activites, exceptions, faults and security events. the organisation should ensure that such logs are produced, lept and regularly reviewed
```

Logs are valuable to investigate incidents, events that led to security problems and to determine who is accountable for different activites

For every information processing facility there should be an event log kept - that is independent and not accessible by the user

Guidelines from ISO 27002:

- user IDs
- system activities
- dates, times and details of key events, e.g. log-on and log-off
- device identity or location if possible
-- records of successful and rejected system access attempts
- changes to system configuration
- use of privileges
- use of system utilities and applications
- files accessed
- alarms raised
- activitation and de-activation of protected systems, such as the anti-virus systems
- records of transaction executed by users in applications...

Review of logs should respect the segregation of duty principle.

Logs should be kept for a sufficent period of time so that they can be used if needed for an investigation


```
Control - 12.4.2. Protection of log information

The organisation should protect logging facilites and log information against tampering and unauthorised access
```

The information contained in logs is valuable as long as its integrity is preserved

Controls should aim to protect agains unauthorised changes like:
- editng or deleting the information recorded
- modifying the type of information that is being recorded or 
- overwriting logs because storage capacity is exceeded

A method to safeguard logs is to copy them in real time to a system outside the control of the system adminsitrator


```
Control - 12.4.3. Adminsitrator and operator logs

The activites of system administrators and the activites of operators should be logged and the logs should be protected and reviewed regularly
```

A user with privileges amy be able to manipulate logs so its necessary to employ some protection for such situations

An intrusion detection system amanged outside the control of the adminsitrator is a solution proposed by ISO/IEC 27002 for the control of logs



```
Control - 12.4.4. Clock synchronisation

the clocks of all relevant information system within an organisation or security domain should be synchronised to a single reference time source
```

An internal reference time should be established, documented and implemented

Clock synchronisation is needed because most logs are time and date stamped

In most cases - reference time is local time.
For organisation with multiple locations - a reference time should be decided

All system clocks should be automatically synchronised with a master clock


## 43 Control and operational software

### Security category - 12.5 Control of Operational Software

```
Control - 12.5.1 installation of software on operation systems

The organisation should have procedures for the installation of software on operational systems
```

Systems can be affected by the installation of unauthorised software and by unauthorised changes to software

Procedures should be implemented to control the installation of software on operation systems

Guidelines from ISO 27002:
- updating of the operational software, applications and program libraries should only be performed by trained personnel and with authorisation

- operational systems should only hold approved executable code and not development code or compilers

- application operating system software should be implemented only after successful testing

- there has to be a strategy for situations where changes to software go wrong

- previous versions of application software should be retained as for contingency purposes

- old versions of software should be archived

Physical or logical access to suppliers for software support should only be given for specific activites, under approval from amangement and be it should be monitored


## 44 Technical vulnerability management

### Security Category - 12.6 Technical vulnerability management

```
Control - 12.6.1. Management of technical vulnerabilities

The organisation should be able to obtain information about vulnerabiliteies of its information systems, its exposure to such vulnerabiliteis should be evaluated and appropriate measures should be taken to address the risks

Technical vulnerabilites being exploited is among the most commong type of attacks on organisations information systems.

Guidelines of ISO 27002:
- defining responsibilites for vulnerability mangament

- find a suitable software to identity technical vulnerabilites

- set timelines to react since being notified about a potential vulnerability

- once a technical vulnerability has been identified - assess associated risks and decidedd actions

- if a path is available from a legitimate source the risks associated with installing the patch should be assessed and patches should be tested before being installed. there should be a possibility to uninstall apatch and go back to the previous state

- if no patch is available some other actions should be taken - turning off services related to the vulnerability, changing or adding acess controls ( like firewalls ); increasing monitoring to detect attacks and raising awareness


```
Control - 12.6.2 Restrictions on software installation

The organisation should established and implement rules for the installation of software by users
```

In most organisations a certain group of users enjoy increased privileges - allowing them to install software.

But uncontrolled installation of software on computing devices can lead to introducing vulnerabilities and security incidents

**Use of least privilege to be applied**

Rules on what types of software installations are permitted and what installations are prohibited



## 45 Info sec audit considerations

### Security category - 12.7 Information systems audit considerations

```
Control - 12.7.1 Information system audit considerations

Audit activities, especially those that involve verification of operational systems, should be planned and agreed so that the disruption to business activites is minimal
```

**The audits of information systems should be carefully planned and the schedule of audit activities should be agreed**

No informaiton should be changed during audit activities and access should be logged as in the case of any other operation

**The audit should be limited to read-only access to software and data**
If some audit tests that could affect system availability are needed to performed during the audit - they should be scheduled to run outside business hours.

Audit activities should cause as little interruptions to business activities as possible
