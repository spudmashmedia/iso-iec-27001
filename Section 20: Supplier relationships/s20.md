The contracts signed with teh suppliers should include all relevant information security requirements

**The contracts signed with supplier depends on the risks involved but the best practice is to make the contracts as detailed as possible in terms of information security**

Suppliers should not be allowed access to the organisation's assets before the contracts are not agreed and signed and any other controls agreed by the parties are not implemented.

 
**Guidance of ISO/IEC 27002 on elements to be included in supplier agreements:**

- obligation of the supplier to comply to the organisation's policies

- asking the supplier to propagate the organisation's security reequirements throughout the supply chain
