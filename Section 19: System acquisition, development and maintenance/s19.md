## 48 Security requirements of information systems

### Security category - 14.1 Security requirements of information systems

```
Control - 14.1.1. Information security requirements analysis and specification

The organisation should include security requirements in its requirements for new information systems or enhancements to existing information systems
```

**The organisation needs to recognise information security requirements from the first stages of information system acquisition or development

There are 2 different situations:
- the information system is developed specifcally for the organisation, or by the organisation itself
- the system is acquired as a commercial product not personlised

The level of security requirements and controls should reflect of course the business value of the information involved and the potential negative impact over the business in case this information is not adequately protected


```
Control - 14.1.2 Securing application services on public networks

Information from application services that are passing over public networks should be protected from fraudulent activity, contract dispute and unauthorised disclosure and modification
```


Many Security requirements can be addressed by using cryptography
- encyrption to ensure the confidentiality of information like billing details and personal information
- digital signatures to ensure the integrity of electronic transactions and to authenticate the partners in the transactions
- both encryption and digital signatures to achieve non-repudiation that mayu be needed in case of disputes on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a certain event

**If the organisation is using or providing applicaiton services over public networks it should have clear regulation that define:**

- who is allowed to carry out electronic commerce activities and what is the employee authorised to do

- how segregation of dutites is ensured - activities that in combination can be used to commit fraud should not be performed by the same person
- what controls are in place to monitor activities and ensure protection of the information involved


```
Control - 14.1.3. Protecting application service transactions

Information used for transactions has to be protected against incomplete transmission, mis-routing, unauthorised message alterations, unauthorised disclosure, unauthorised message duplication or replay
```

**The security considerations provided by ISO/IEC 27002 refer to:

- the use of electronic signatures
- aspects on the transaction - privacy of the parties, confidentiality of the transactions, verification and validation of the user's authentication information
- encryption of the communication between parties
- the use of secure protocols for communication between the parties involved in the transaction
- storage of the transaction details outside any publicly accesible environment



## 49 Security in development and support part 1

### Security Category - 14.2 Security in development and support processes

```
Control - 14.2.1. Secure development policy

The organisation should develop and apply rules for the development of software and systems
```

**The secure development policy should address aspects like**

- Security of the development environment
- Guidelines for secure coding trhat should be used
- Security checkpoints within the project milestones
- Security in the version control

**Unsafe coding may lead to vulnerabilities**

```
Control - 14.2.2. System change control procedures

Thge organisation should use a change control procedure to handle changes to systems within the development lifecycle
```

**A system is more vulnerable whever it undergoes change**

**A risk assessment and analysis on the impact of change should exist along with the specificaiton of security controls needed**

Procedures for change control should address aspects like
- authorisation of changes
- fallback arrangements
- reviews and tests
- version control of all software updates
- audit trail of all changes
- Update system documentation on the completion of the change
- implementing changes so that distubance to business processes is minimal


```
Control - 14.2.3. Technical review of appliations after operating platform changes

Whenever the organisation is making changes to its operating platforms, critical application should be reviewed and tested to ensure there is no adverse impact on operations or security
```

**Changes to oeprating system software should be under control**

ISO/IEC 27002 recommends to have a formal process to review the applications and test for possible vulnerabilities that may appear after a new operating system is implemenmted or the existing one is changed


```
Control - 14.2.4. Restirctions to changes to software packages

The organisation should discourage modifications to software packages and limit them to necessary changes. All changes should be strictly controlled.
```

**Changes to software packages and especially to vendor-supplied software should be made only if trhere is a really critical business need to do so.

If a software package needs to be modified to suit a business need the following should be considered:
- risk assessment to identify the potential vulnerabilities
- need for a consent from the vendor for the changes
- if the changes result in vendor support for the software package to cease
- retain the original of the software and make chagnes to a copy
- test the software after implementing the changes before starting to use it


```
Control - 14.2.5 Secure system engineering principles

The organisation should establish, document, maintain and apply principles for engineering secure systems for all its implemenmtation efforts
```

**Security engineering focuses on the security aspects in the design of systems that need to be able to deal with possible sources of disruption, ranging from natural disasters to malicious acts

```nist.org - SP 800-160 (System security engineering)```

**Principles for security engineering have to be reviewed periodically to ensure they are still up-to-date**


## 50 Security in development and support part 2

```
Control - 14.2.6 Secure Development environment

The organisation should establish and porotect secure development environments for system development integration efforts that cover the entire system development lifecycle
```

**Development environment includes people, processes and technology**

**Aspects to be considered in defining security requirements for the development environment:**

- sensitivity of the data being processed, stored and transmitted
- regulation applicable - external or internal policies
- trustworthiness of personnel involved
- outsourced activities
- access control to the development environment
- storing backups in secure offsite locations


```
Control - 14.2.7. Outsourced development

outsourced system development should be supervised and monitored
```

**Development outsourcing involves risks since the process is not under the control of the organisation**

The organisation should have clear agreements with the software development suppliers to protect against risks and to ensure on-time delivery of the product and functionality aspects

**Control of the software development supplier depends on the risks involved:**
- testing of deliverables
- audting the supplier organisation's development environment


```
Controls - 14.2.8. System security testing

The organisation should test security funcitonalities during development
```

**Security testing should  be carried before operational implementation of the product.**

For in-house developments such tests should be performed by the development team and the extent of testing should be of course proportional to the importance and nature of the system

```
Control - 14.2.9. System acceptance Testing

The organisation should establish acceptance testing programs and criteria for new information systems, upgrades and for new versions.
```

**New or changed systems can bring in unknown vulnerabilities.**

The organisation should define acceptance criteria and testing to ensure that those criteria are met before the new system is introduced.

Automated tools can be used - like code analysis tools or vulnerability scanners and security related defects should be remediated.


### Security Category - 14.3. Test Data

```
Control - 14.3.1. Protection of test data

Test data should be selected carefully, protected and controlled.
```

**Avoid the use of operational data containing personally identifiable information or any other confidential information for testing pruposes**

Guidelines of ISO/IEC 27002 for protecting operational data used for testing:
- Use the same access control procedures for test application systems as for operation systems
- existence of an authorisation each time opoerational information is used in a test environment
- after testing is finalised the data is no longer needed should be securely erased from the test system
- Logging the use of operational information for testing purposes
