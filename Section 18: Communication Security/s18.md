## 46 Network security management

### Security Category - 13.1 Network Security Management

```
Control - 13.1.1. Network controls

The networks have to be controlled and managed so that the information in systems and applications is protected
```

Networks are vulnerable to unauthorised access, to misuse or abuse and to unintentional fallings of technology

ISO/IEC 27001 requires the organisation to implement controls to ensure the security of the information passing through networks and the protection of devices connected to the networks

Guidelines (ISO IEC 27002):
- define responsibilities and procesures for the management of network equipment

- define and apply some supplementatary controls to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data passing over public networks or through wireless networks - as the risks are considerably higher

- constantly monitor of the network

- ensure the authentication of systems connected to the network and restrict connections

**ISO/IEC 27033 - about network security**


```
Control - 13.1.2 Security of network services

The organisation should identify and include in network service agreements security mechanisms, service levels and management requirements for all network services. Thjis is applicable irrespective whether the network services are provided in-house or by a third party
```

**Third party supplied network services carrry a risk of unauthorised access attempts that may lead to security breaches**

Network services may include - provision of connections, private network services, security solutions for the networks (like firewalls or instrusion detection systems)...

The organisation should agree with the service provider (and document in the contracts) on the security features for the services it provides and should monitor the services to see if they meet requirements.

```
Control - 13.1.3 Segregation in networks

Groups of information services, users and information systems should be segregated on networks
```

**The bigger the network, the higher the risk**

**Security can be managed easier if the network is divided into physical or logical domains and security measures are implemented to manage the gateways between the domains**

The segregation can be done using phyusically different networks or by applying connection and routing controls


The permieter for each domain should be well defined and the acess between network domains should be controlled using a gateway

Wireless networks - difficult to define exactly the perimeter - ISO/IEC 27002 recommends for sensitive networks (where critical data is stored or processed) to treat all wireless access as external connections and to segregate the access from internal networks and the pass the wireless access through a gateway before accessing internal systems

The domains and their relationship should be documented in a network map or similar document

special care for networks that spread beyond organisation's boundaries

## 47 Information transfer

## Security category - 13.2 Information transfer

```
Control - 13.2.1. Information transfer policies and procedures

The organisation should have transfer polices, procedures and controls to protect the transfer of information for all types of communication facilities

**Exchange of information carry the risk of the information being compromised**


Guidelines:
- rules to protect against malware that can be transmitted through the use of electronic communications

- rules for acceptable use of communication facilities

- explicit rules forbidding employees to compromise the organisation (ex through defamtion, harassment, impersonation, forwarding of chain letters, unauthorised purchasing)

- encrypt information (if needed)

- rules of the retention and disposal of business correspondence

- not leaving messages containing confidential information on answering machines since these may be replayed bu unauthorised persons

- not leaving sensitive information in printers or fax machines

- personnel reminded not to have confidential conversations in public places or through insecure communication channels

**Rules should be communicated to all staff**

```
Control - 13.2.2. Agreements on information transfer

The organisation should include in agreements with other parties the secure transfer of business information
```

ISO/IEC 27002 recommends to document in the contracts the level of security expected for sensitive information passing between organisation and its controls applied

**Example elements to be included in the contracts:**

- management responsibilites for controlling and notifying transfmissions, dispatch and receipt

- procedures to ensure traceability and non-repudiation

- minimum technical standards for packaging and transmission

- escrow agreements

- courier identification

- responsibilites and authorities in case of security incidents

- agreeing on a common system of labelling information between the parties


```
Control - 13.2.3. Electronic Messaging

information exchanged through electronic messaging should be appropriately protected
```

Email involves many risks if used withouth appropriate controls (ex financial fraud, infection, legal issues)

**There should be some rules or procedures in place fo rthe use of email and tis essential that staff are aware of: the risks involved, the organisations requirements and the control mechanisms in place.


```
Contorl - 13.2.4. Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements

The organisation should have suitable confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements that are in line with the neds for the protection of information
```

**Before giving access to confidential information - to employees or external personnel and organisations the organisation should ensure that confidientiality agreements are signed**

Elements to be included in NDA:

- a definition of the information to be protected (ex confidential information)

- ownership of information and the rights to use confidential information by the signatories

- expected duration of th eagreement, including cases where confidentiality might need to be maintained indefinitely

- responsibilities ans actions of the signatories to avoid information being disclosed

- the process of notification and reporting in case of unauthorised access to confidiential information

- expected actions in case the agreement is breached
