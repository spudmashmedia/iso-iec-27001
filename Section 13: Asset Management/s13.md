## 28 Repsonsibility for assets

### Security category - 8.1 Responsibility for assets

```
Control - 8.1.1 Inventory of assets

The organisation has to identify all assets associated with information and information processing facilities and should create and establish an inventory of assets
```

**The inventory is expected to include:**
- physical assets - equipment identity, location, maker, model, serial number and inventory tag
- documentation - including system documentation, contracts, procedures and business continuity plans etc
- software products - including licensing information and where they are used
- services - including utilities

**Asset inventory should be kept up to date**


```

- define and review access restrictions to the asset
- ensure proper handling when the asset is deleted or destroyed


```
Control - 8.1.3 Acceptable use of assets

the organisation should identify, document and implement rules for the acceptable use of assets associated with information and information processing facilities
```

Individuals should be made aware of the security requirements associated with the assets and should be responsible for the use of the resources

Organisations are vulnerable to misuse of their assets by employees - international or not - refers to use of assets in a way that is different than their business prupose

## 29 Information classification

### Security Category - 8.2 Information classification

```
Control - 8.2.1 Classification of information

information needs to ber classified taking into consideration legal requirements, value of information, criticality  and sensivity to unauthorised disclosure or modification
```

The organisation has to develop a classificaiton scheme

Owners of information assets are accountable for their classification

Recommended to have an easy to understand classification scheme

classification should be done by taking into consideration the level of protection needed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information

the classification scheme has to be consistent across the whole organisation


ISO/IEC 27002 provides an example of classification scheme that uses 4 level:

- Public: disclosure causes no harm
- Internal use: disclosure causes minor embarrassment or minor operational inconvenience
- confidential: disclosure has a significant short term impact on operations or tactical objectives
- top secret: disclosure has a serious impact on long term strategic objectives or puts the survival of th eorganisation at risk


```
Control - 8.2.2 Labelling of information

Starting from the classification scheme the organisation should develop procedures for the labelling of information
```

**Labelling reflect the level of classification**

Procedures for information labelling need to cover information and its related assets in physical and electronic formats

employees and contractors should be made aware of the labelling procedures

when receiving information from other organisations - care should be given to the labels of documents as other organisations may have different definitions for the same labels

```
Control - 8.2.3 Handling of assets

the orgainisation should implement procedures for the handling of assets in the line with the classification scheme
```

**Procedures for asset handling are meant to prevent the risk of sensitive information being mishandled and should detail:**

- access restrictions for each level of classification
- protection of copies (temporary or permanent) in the same way as the originals
- storage requirements according to the classification level
- declassification and destruction according to classification

## 30 Media handling

### Security category - 8.3 Media handling

```
Control - 8.3.1 Mangement of removable media

Procedures should be implememented for the management of removable media in accordance with th4e classification scheme adopted by the organisation
```

Removable media (flash disks, removable hard drives, cds, dvds, printed media, etc) containing the organisation's data presents a vulnerability to loss of data and breaches of confidentiality

Controls implemented have to address issues like:
- using removable media only if there is a business reason to do so
- storing media in safe and secure environments
- contents of re-usable media to be removed from the organisation should be made unrecoverable
- the organisation may use encryption of data on removable media
- transfer useful data on fresh media to prevent media degrading in time
- have multiple copies of valuable information on seperate media


```
Control - 8.3.2 Disposal of media

When no longer needed media shall be disposed of according to procedures
```

Procedures for secure disposal reduce the risk of confidential informationm leakage to unauthorised persons

ISO/IEC 27002 guidance of disposal of media:
- identify the items that require secure disposal
- store and dispose securely media with confidential information (with methods like incineration, shredding, erasure of data - depending on the media)
- perform a careful selecting of the provider for collection and disposal services (if such a provider is used for disposal of media)
- keep a logt of the disposal of sensitive items


```
Control - 8.3.3 Physical media transfer

Media that contains information has to be protected during transportation against unauthorised access, misuse or corruption
```

Transportation of media = risks for loss, corruption, unauthorised access and misuse

Guidelines for transportation of media:
- use of reliable couriers and make verification of courier identity
- use suitable packaging to protect the contents from phyusical damage and protection from environmental factors - like heat or electromagnetic fields
- to minitgate the risk of breach of confidentiality if media are lost or stolen - data to be transported should be encrypted and of course the encryption key should never be sent together with the encrypted data
