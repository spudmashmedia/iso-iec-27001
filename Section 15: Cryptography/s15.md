## 35 Cryptographic controls

### Security Category - 10.1 Cryptographic controls

```
Control - 10.1.1 Policy on the use of cryptographic controls

the organisation should develop and implemenmt a policy for the use of cryptographic controls
```

**Cryptography is a system of coding information so it can be accessible selectively**

Symmetric - use a single key to encrypt and to decrypt data

Asymmetric - uses what is called "public key"


Among the uses of cryptography:

- protecting information that goes out of the organisation
- limiting access to files or folders on the servers
- protecting confidential information sent on the servers
- protecting passwords
- securing payments
- digital signatures

**The decision whether to use or not cryptographic controls belongs to the organisation and to its needs to protect the information**


ISO/IEC 27002 recommends a policy for the use of cryptographic controls that should address a few aspects:

- general principles under which busines information should be protected and the approach on the use of cryptographic controls

- encryption algorithm used

- approached about using encryption for protection of information taken outside the organisation

- approach to key management - how are they protected and what happens in case keyhs are lost or compromised

- responsibilities - who is in charge for the implementation of this policy and the management of the keys

- consistent implementation of the cryptographic controls throughout the whole organisation

There are regulations and restirictions to the use of cryptographic controls that may exist in different countries and jurisdictions.


```
Control - 10.1.2 Key management

There should be a policy on the use, protection and lifetime of cryptographic keys
```

**The organisation has to protect the cryptographic keys against loss, modification, unauthorised access and disclosure**

Key management process should cover the whole lifecycle of the keys - generating, storing it, archiving, retrieving, distributing, retiring and destroying of keys



Policy on key management: a set of rules that will apply to a number of activites like:

- generating keys for different types of cryptographic systems and applications

- issuing and obtaining public key certificates

- distributing keys and their activation when received

- storing keys

- changing and updating keys

- dealing with compromised keys

- revoking keys - how are they withdrawn or deactivated

- recovering keys that have been lost or corrupted

- backup and archiving keys

- destroying keys

- logging and auditing key management related activites

To reduce the likelihood of improper use IS/IEC 27002 recommends defining activation deactivation dates for keys - so that they can only be used for a period of time
