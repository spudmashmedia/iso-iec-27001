# Section 4: Planning

## 9 Info Sec Risk Assement

The orgainsation is required to develop and apply a risk assessment process

1. start from information assets and try to identify the threats and vulnerabilities related to the assets

2. evaluate impact if the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information are compromised

3. calculate the likelihood (or probability) of an event happening

4. estimate the level of risk as a combination of impact and likelihood

5. assign risk owners

6. define what is considered acceptable risk and what is not acceptable

use:
- asset
- threat
- vulnerability
- impact
- likelihood
- risk level
- acceptable
- risk owner

Estimation of impact, likelihood and level:
- qualitative: use levels (high, low, medium)
- quantitative: use numbers
- semi-quantitative: using numerical ratings to generate a level

established criteria:
- acceptable risk / not acceptable risk

risk owners - persons (strucrtures) who are accountable for the management of the management of the risk


```
Risk assessment is subject

... but you should create a list of risks as comprehensive as possible
```
ISO standards on risk assessment
- ISO 31000
- IEC 31010
- ISO/IEC 27005

```
Risk assessment should be document
```

*Note: Use Annex A


## 10 Info Sec Risk Treatment

### Possible options to treat risks:
- avoid the risk
- control the risk and reduce risk level
- transfer the risk
- accept the risk
- or a combination of those

the choice belongs to the organisation and should be balanced taking into account resources and impact

### Statement of Applicability (SoA)

```
" the organisation shall produce a Statement of Applicability"
```

SoA - is the map of implementations of the ISMS
Includes
- all the controls
- their justification for inclusion
- whether they are implemented or not
- justification for excluding any controls from the Annex A (of ISO/IEC 27001)

SoA should be revised as the activities of the organisation suffer changes

use
- No
- controls
- detailed
- Justification for inclusion
- Justification for exclusion
- Implemented (y/N)
- evidence of implementation

### Risk Treatment Plan

Includes:
- the risk that is being addressed and its level according to the assessment
- the aciton proposed to treat the risk
- who is in charge iwth implementing the actions
- resources (budget)
- timeframe for implementation

### Residual Risk
The remaining risk after treatment action are applied.
Residual risk needs to be evaluated similar to the inital process to see if it falls into the acceptable category. If not, new treatment should be decided

objectain the approval of the risk owners for the risk treatment plan as well as for the risidual risks

```
Risk treatment has to be documented
```

## 11 Info Sec Objectives

- consistent with the info sec policy
- measurable (if practicable)
- take into account info sec requirements, risk assement and risk treatment
- comminicated and updated

```
Info Sec objectives have to be documented
```
