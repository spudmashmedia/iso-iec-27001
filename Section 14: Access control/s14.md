# Section 14: Access control

## 31 business requirements for access control

### Security category - 9.1 Business requirements for access control

```
Control - 9.1.1. Access control policy

the organisation should document an access control policy

```

Access control refers to both logical and physical access

Access control rules, access rights and restrictions for specific user roles should be established

Asset owners decide access rights to assets based on business needs


**An access control poilicy should exist and should address some elements:**
- security requirements for different business application
-consistency between access rights and information classification
- legislation and contractual obligations regarding limitation of access to data or services
- segregation of roles that refer to access control
- periodic review of access rights
- removal of access rights
- roles that have privileged access

Principle: **Need-to-know and need-to-use**

Use: "**Everything is generally forbidden unless expressly permitted**"
instead of
"**Everything is generally permitted unless expressly forbidden**"


```
Control - 9.1.2 Access to networks and network services

Users should onlyh have access to the network and network services that they have been specifically authorized to use
```

ISO/IEC 27002 recommends a policy on the access to networks that should cover:

- the networks and networks services which are allowed to be access
- authorisation procedures for determining who is allowed to access which networks and services
- what controls are in place to protect access to networks and services
- how are the networks and network services accessed (ex use of VPN or wireless)
- what are the requirements for the user authentication to allow access to networks and services
- how the use of network services is monitored

Users logging to a network, computer or application should have access only to the information and services required for their business function that they have been authorised to use

## 32 User access management

### Security category - 9.2 user access Management

```
Control - 9.2.1 User registration and de-registration

There has to be a formal user registration and de-registration process to enable assignment of access rights
```

**Every user should be formally authorised and registered to each information system, network or service that is accesses for the business needs**

Management of user IDs:
- use unique user IDs to enable users to be linked to their actions
- immediately disable or remove user IDs of users who have left the organisation
- periodically identify and remove or disable redudant user IDs
- ensure that redundant user IDs are not issued to other users


```
Control - 9.2.2 User access provisioning

The organisation should implement a formal user access provisioning process to assign or to revoke access rights for all user types to all systems and services
```

- the owner of the information system is responsible to approve or revoking of access rights to user IDs
- access rights should not be activated before authorization
- a central record of access rights granted to each user ID should be kept
- access rights should be adapted for users who change roles or jobs and remove for users who left the organisation

An easier way to manage access rights is by using role based access - defining user profiles for different roles and positions in the organisation

Define sanctions for unauthorised access


```
Control - 9.2.3 Management of priviledged access rights

The allocation of privileged access rights should be controlled and there should be a formal process for this
```

Privileges = means to shortcut controls
Uncessarry allocations and use of privileges may lead to security breaches

ISO/IEC 27002 recommendations on the allocation of privileged access rights:
- clear identification of privlege access rights and the users for every application, operating system, database etc
- allocation of privileged access rights on a need-to-use basis and preferably on a event-by-event basis
- use an authorisation process for granting privileged access rights and not grant them until authorisation is obtained
- assign the privilege access rights to a user ID that is different from the ones used for regular business activities



```
Control - 9.2.4 Management of secret authentication information of users

There should be a formal process for the allocation of secret authentication information
```

Secret authenticcation is done usually through passwords

Requirements for allocation of secret authentication information:
- users should be asked to sign a statement to keep personal secret authentication information (passwords) confidential
- if the users select their own passwords - they should be provided initially with a temporary password that they should be forced to change
- passwords should be given to users in a secure manner and the users should acknowledge their receipt


```
Control - 9.2.5 Review of users access rights

Asset owners should periodically review user's access rights
```

Access rights have to be based on business needs and when the business need changes or passes the access should be cancelled

Period access rights should be reviewed and if found that some access rights are not needed they have to be withdrawn.


```
Control - 9.2.6 Removal of users of access rights

At the end of employment or contract the access rights of employees or external parties should be removed. In case of changing positions the access rights should be adjusted
```

If an employment is terminated the access rights associated should be removed

If the user is part of a group - and access rights are allocated at group level - the individual leaving should be removed from the group and the other members should be informed to no longer share information with the person departing.

## 33 User responsibilities

### Security Category - 9.3 User Responsibilities 

```
Control - 9.3.1 Use of secret authentication information

The users are to be required to follow the organisation procedures for the use of secret authentication information
```

Users need to be aware of the fact that they can be held accountable for someone else using their passwords


ISO/IEC 27002 guidelines for users choosing and managing passwords

- users should be advised to keep secret passwords confidential
- avoid keeping a record of passwords (unless there is a password vault app)
- if possible compromise - change the password
- advise users not to use the same password for both business and non-business purposes
- select quality passwords
    - sufficient length but be easy to remember
    - not baseed on things easy to guess (name, birthdate)
    - not vulnerable to dictionary attacks

Single Sign On - convenience (don't have to remember multiple passwords)
- security risk (in case it is compromised)

## 34 System and application access control

### Security category - 9.4 System and application access control

```
Control - 9.4.1 Information access restriction

Access to information and application should be restricted in line with the acces control policy
```

**Restrictions of access to information should be based on individual business requirements**

Some guidelines on the restirction requirements include:
- control the access of users in terms of what they can do - read, write, delete, execute
- control which data can be accessed by each particular user
- control the access rights of applications
- provide menus to control access to application system functions


```
Control - 9.4.2 Secure log-on procedures

Access to systems and applications should be controlled with a secure log-on procedure
```

The log-on procedure needs to be:
- easy to understand
- user-friendly
- must not give information about the system or application that the user is trying to access (before accessing it)
- should minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access

ISO/IEC 27002 guidlines for a good log-on procedure

a) not displaying system or application identifiers until the log-on is completed

b) displaying a general notice warning that the computer should only be accessed by authorised users

c) not providing help messages during the log-on

d) validate the log-on information only on completion

e) protect against brute force log-on attempts

f) record unsuccessful and successful attempts

g) raise security event if a potential attempted or successful breach of log-on

h) display the following information on completion of a successful log-on: date and time of the previous successful log-on; details of any unsuccessful log-on attempts

i) do not display the password being entered

j) do not transmit passwords in clear text over a network

k) terminate inactive sessions after a defined period of inactivity

j) restrict connection times to provide additional security for high-risk applicaitons


```
Control - 9.4.3 Password management system

The organisation should use interactive password management systems that ensure quality passwords
```

A password management system should:

- enforce the use of individual user IDs and passwords to maintain accountability

- allow users to select and change their own passwords and includes a confirmation procedure 

- enforce a choice of quality passwords

- force users to change their passwords at the first log-on

- enforce regular password changes and as needed

- maintain a record of previously used passwords and prevent the re-use of past passwords

- not display passwords on the screen when being entered

- store password files seperately from application system data

- store and transmit passwords in protected form



```
Control - 9.4.4 Use of privileged utility programs

The organisation should restrict and strictly control the use of utility programs that are capable of overriding system and application controls
```

**Because utility programs may provide access to the parts of the system by overriding controls they can be risk for security**

The use of such programs be controlled:
- users have to be identified and authorised for their use and logs should be maintained

- the use of utility programs should be limited to the minimum needed

- utility programs should be segregated from application software and users should not have access to privilege functions from their normal user accounts


```
Control - 9.4.5 Access to program source code

Access to program source code should be restricted
```

**Unauthorised access to program source code can be a great opportunity for an intruder to modify the system**

**Use of libraries - methods to protect source code**

There are a few requirements for the source code libraries:

- as much as possible libraries should not be held in operation systems

- there have to be some rules for the management of program source code and libraries where they are stored

- the updating of program source libraries should only be done with authorization

- all accesses to program source libraries should be logged

- maintenance and copying of program source libraries should be subject to strict change control procedures
