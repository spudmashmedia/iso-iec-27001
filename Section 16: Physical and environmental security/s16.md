## 36 Physical and enviornment security - Secure areas

### Security category - 11.1 Physical and environmental security

```
Control - 11.1.1 Physical security perimeter

The organisation should define and use security permiters to protect aareas that contain either sensiteve or critical information and information processing facilities
```

**The premises of the organisation may be at the risk of unauthorised access**

Guidelines for securing physical permieters refer to:
- define permieters and establish controls depending on the security requirements of the assets in each perimeter

- ensure protection of the permeters - doors, windows, roofs, walls, flooring

- reception of similar area to control the physical access

- fire doors should be alarmed, monitored and tested

- intruder detection system should be installed and unoccupied areas should be alarmed at all times

**Have multiple barriers or systems to prevent unauthorised access so the failure of one barrier does not compromise the securityh immediately**


```
Control - 11.1.2 Physical entry controls

There should be entry controls to ensure that only authorised personnel are allowed to access secure areas
```

Guidelines for designing entry controls:

- date & time of entry and departure should be recorded
- identity of the visitors should be confirmed and recorded
- access to areas where confidential information is processed or stored should be restricted to authorized individuals
- all access should be logged
- employees, contractors and external parties should wear visual  identification;
- external parties personnel shjould not be allowed to areas where confidential information is being processed (unless its critical and they should be monitored)
- physical access rights to areas should be reviewed regularly


```
Control - 11.1.3 Securing offices, rooms and facilities

The organisation should design and apply physical protection measures for offices, rooms and facilities
```

**Control measures for offices, rooms and facilities should be suitable to the value and importance of assets inside.**

- key facilities should be sited to avoid access by the public
- the organisation should avoid the use of signs about the information processing facilities inside the rooms (ex server room)
- Facilities should be configured to prevent confidential information or activities from being visible and audible from outside. Electromagnetic shielding may be needed
- directories and phone books should not be readily accessible to anyone from outside the organisation

```
Control - 11.1.4 Protecting agains external and environmental threads

the organisation needs to have physical protection against natural disasters, malicious attack or accidents
```

Damage due to earthquake, fire, flooding, explosions, civil unrest or other forms of natural or man-made disasters.

For many of those in most countries there is a specific legislations and ISO/IEC 27002 recommends the use of specialist advice on this matter


```
Control - 11.1.5 Working in secure areas

The organisation should develop and use procedures for working in secure areas
```

**Secure areas - locations where critical information is being processed or stored, information that has great commercial value to the organisation**

Guidelines: 
- personnel should only be aware of the existence of, or activities within a secure area on a need-to-know basis
- onlyu authorised personnel shall be allowed inside
- unsupervised work in secure area should be avoided as much as possible and depending of course on the specifics of the area
- vacant secure areas should be locked and checked periodically
- photogrpahic, video and audio recording equipment should not be allowed in secure areas unless specifically authorised


```
Control - 11.1.6 Delivery and loading areas

Delivery and loading areas, as well as any other access points where unauthorised persons could enter the premises should be controlled and if its possible they should be isoloated from the information processing facilities to avoid unauthorised access
```

Uncontrolled access of public from outside can lead to security breaches

Guidelines:

- delivery and laoding areas should be desinged so that delivery and loading personnel cannot access other parts of the building from the areas

- external doors of delivery and loading areas should be closed when internal doors that lead inside the organisation are open

- if possible incoming material should be checked for explosives, chemicals or hazardous material before entering the delivery and loading area

- as much as possible it is recommended to segregate incoming and outgoing shipments

- records of deliveries and dispatches shouuld be kept (on paper or video recording)

## 37 Physical and environment security - Equipment part 1

### Security Category - 11.2 Equipment

```
Control - 11.2.1 Equipment stting and potection

The equipment needs to be sited and protected from environmental threats and hazards and unauthorised access
```

Equipment is vulnerable to damage, to unauthorised viewing and to interference

Guidelines:
- equipment should be sited to minimize unnecessary access to work areas
-equipment where senstive info is processed should be positioned so that the risk of info being viewed by unauthorised persons is reduced
- controls should be in place ot reduce the risk of physical or environmental threats
- guidelines in place for eating, drinking and smoking
- temperature and humidityu should be monitored (if needed)
- use of special protection methods (ex keyboard membranes) - if needed


```
Control - 11.2.2 Supporting utilities

The organisation should protect its equipment from power failures and other disruptions caused by failures in supporting utilities
```

**Supporting utilities include electricity supply, telecommunications, water supply, gas, sewage, ventilation, air conditioning, heating**

A problem with any supporting utility should be identified by an alarm system.
Supporting utilities should be in line with the legal requirements and meet the needs of business growth.
They should be inspected regularly to ensure proper functioning.

Redundant connections for network connectivity should be obtained through the use of more than one provider.


```
Control - 11.2.3 Cabling security

Power and telecommunications ccabling carrying data or supporting information services should be protected from interception, interference of damage
```

Guidelines:
- power and telecommunications lines should be underground where possible
- power cables should be segregated from communication cables to prevent interference
- for critical systems further controls include: armoured conduit and locked rooms or boxes at inspection and termination points; use of electromagnetic shielding of the cables; controlled access to patch panels and ccable rooms as well as inspection for unauthorised devices attached


```
Control - 11.2.4 Equipment maintenance

Equipment should be maintained to ensure its integrity and availability
```

Guidelines:
- respecting the supplier's recommendation service intervals and specifications

Assets off-site should be protected taking into consideration the different risks involved by working outside the organisation premises
```

**The use of equipment outside the premises involves many security threats**

When using equipment or media outside:

- it should not be left unattended in public places and it should be protected (according to its manufacturer specifications - ex protection from electromagnetic fields)

- if the equipment is transferred between individuals there should be a log that defines the chain of custody


```
Control - 11.2.7 Secure disposal or re-use of equipment

Before disposal or re-use, all equipment containing storage media shall be verified to ensure sensitive data and licensed software has been removed or securely overwritten
```

**Have controls in place to ensure that equipment to be disposed of or re-used does not contain sensitive information

if storage media contains confidential or copyrighted information then this has to be securely deleted or overwritten so it can be retrieved.

Consider destorying of media containing sensitive information as a method of disposal

simple deleting of fies is usually not enough



```
Control - 11.2.8 Unattended user equipment

Unattended equipment should be protected
```

Unattended equipment may provide an opportunity for security breaches

Users should be advised to:

- terminate active sessions when finished or secure them with a password
