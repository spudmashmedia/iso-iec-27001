# Section 21: Information security  incident management

## 53 Management of Information security incidents part 1

### Security category - 16.1. Management of Information security incidents and improvements

```
Control - 16.1.1. Responsibilities and procedures

There should be responsibilities and procedures in place to response effectively and in time to information security incidents
```

**Consider the idea of creating a list of potential security incidents**

There should be procedures in place to ensure that security incidents are reviewed and investigated

- planning and preparation of incident response

- monitoring, detecting, analyzing and reporting security events and incidents

- logging incident management

- handling of forensic evidence collected

-- escalation of incidents and recovery from an incident

**ISO/IEC 27035 - incident management**


```
Control - 16.1.2. Reporting infromation security events

The organisation is required to establish communication channels for reporting security events as quickly as possible
```

What can be considered a security  event that needs to be reported

- a security control that is not effective
- human errors
- a virus deteced on a system
- nbreaches of physical security leading to theft
- passwords being exposed
- hardware or software that is not functioning correctly
- uncontrolled system changes
- unauthorised access to systems
- non-compliance with legal requirements or procedures

**A security event can be considered anything that can result in loss or damage to assets or an action that is against the security policies of the organisation**

Point of contact - a person or department where events are being reported and that is the first line of response to the incident.

All personnel should be aware of the contact point identity.

The reporting of events should be standardized and all staff should be advised to report events as soon as possible


```
Control - 16.1.3. Reporting information security weakness

All employees and contractors need to be trained to report any security weakness - be it observed or suspected
```

Weaknesses need to be reported to the point of contact to prevent information security incidents

The reporting mechanism has to be easy, accessible and efficient.

All users should understand that they are required to report any weaknesses and not try to test the weaknesses to be sure or exploit them.


## 54 Management of information security incidents part 2

```
Control - 16.1.4. Assessment and decision on information security events

Information security events are required to be assessed and the organisation needs to decide whether they are to be considered information security incidents
```

Contact point provides initial triage - review of each event and evaluate the impact to decide whether it has to be classified as information security incident.

Criteria for classification of incidents to priotise the actions

The contact point may not be the single decision layer with regards to incidents - the organisation may have an information security incident response team (ISIRT) and the incident will be escalated here for assessment and decision.

```
Control - 16.1.5. Response to information security incidents

After assessment the organisation should respond to information security incidents according to documented procedures
```

**Incidents should be responded to with the first goal being to resume "normal security level" and then initiate recovery**

Guidance from ISO/IEC 27002:
- collect evidence as soon as possible after the occurrence of the incident
- perform forensics analysis
- escalate the incident if necessary
- communicate to all parties that need-to-know about the incident (be it inside or outside the organisation)
- find the weaknesses that lead to the incident and deal with them
- record the incident and close it


```
Control - 16.1.6. Learning from information security incidents

The organisation is required to use the knowledge it gets from dealing with security incidents to learn reduce the likelihood and impact of future incidents
```

**Besides resolving security incidents its important that people learn from the security incidents to avoid them happening in the future or if they happen to deal with them more effectively.**

Case studies and anecdotes from actual security incidents can be used in awareness training as examples of what can happen, how to avoid situations and how to respond


```
Control  - 16.1.7. Collection of evidence

The organisation should collect and preserve information which can serve as evidence according to established procedures
```

**In most cases its not clear whether a certain incident will end up in court or not**
The organisation should collect information that can serve as evidence for every information security incident

**The organisation should have procedures to deal with evidence collected**

ISO/IEC 27037 - guidelines for identification, collection, acquisition and presservation of digital evidence.
